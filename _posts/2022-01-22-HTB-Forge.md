# Machine Information

Forge is rated an Medium box. The box has good double SSRF technique, first it starts with upload page on forge.htb page where I am getting blocked because of filter, I tried few things to bypass it. After successfully bypassing it, I found another domain where I can access its source code. Getting hands on them revealed FTP server with credentials. FTP server is configured for User's home directory where I get its SSH key. User is able to run file inside `/opt/` directory as root where I encountered and bypassed/exploited `pdb`  module's  `post_mortem` function. 

# Enumeration

As usual I ran `nmap`, to scan for any open ports with their services running on them.

```bash
nmap -p- -oA nmap/all 10.10.11.111 --min-rate 10000

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.111
Host is up (0.15s latency).
Not shown: 65471 filtered tcp ports (no-response), 62 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 20.66 seconds
```

So only ssh and http port is running, now I ran `-sC` & `-sV`  flags,

```bash
nmap -p 22,80 -sC -sV -oA nmap/forge 10.10.11.111

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.111
Host is up (0.22s latency).

```

* `-sC` : This will scan the regarding port with default set of scripts from nmap database
* `-sV` : Enables version detection of the regarding port number

 I can discover the OS version just by looking at the [SSH version](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.3) on the Launchpad and it revealed that OS is Ubuntu Focal.

## Port 80

I now visited port 80 and it redirected me to `forge.htb`, I added it to my host file.

> 10.10.11.111    forge.htb forge

I ran `ffuf` against the domain in the background while I poke at the website.

Immediately it showed it `admin.forge.htb` domain.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/04.png" alt="04" style="zoom: 50%;" />

I appended it to host file.

> 10.10.11.111    forge.htb forge admin.forge.htb

# Getting User

## SSRF on forge.htb

While poking at the site there is one directory `/upload` where I uploaded one image and it gave me an URL for that image. As you can see there are 2 ways to upload the image, I uploaded first time using the local file.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/02.png" alt="02" style="zoom:67%;" />

Now I will try to upload it using the URL. I captured the request in BurpSuite and forwarded the Repeater, it is giving randomly generated endpoint for the file like the above.

In the Repeater tab I changed my IP to localhost to see any potential anomaly

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/03.png" alt="03" style="zoom: 50%;" />

After trying numerous things, I went with case sensitive and it gave me an URL to access the output.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/06.png" alt="06" style="zoom:50%;" />

Firefox was unable to show the output, So I used `curl` for this.

## SSRF on admin.forge.htb

When I visited the `admin.forge.htb` it showed that only localhosts are allowed to visit it.

![05](/image/hackthebox/forge/05.png)

The same thing happened, I was getting blocked. I changed the casing from `admin.forge.htb` to `Admin.Forge.htb`, and it gave me an URL to access the file. Doing that with `curl` showed the code for admin portal with `upload` and `announcements` page.

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Admin Portal</title>
</head>
<body>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/main.css">
    <header>
            <nav>
                <h1 class=""><a href="/">Portal home</a></h1>
                <h1 class="align-right margin-right"><a href="/announcements">Announcements</a></h1>
                <h1 class="align-right"><a href="/upload">Upload image</a></h1>
            </nav>
    </header>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <center><h1>Welcome Admins!</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
```

## Discovering FTP

I access the announcements page first and it gave me important information such as 

1. credentials for FTP server, 
2. `upload` page is accessible using various protocols 
3. I can upload an image using `?u=&lt;url&gt;` parameter which after decoding `?u=<url>` 

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/08.png" alt="08" style="zoom:67%;" />

I scanned the host on port 21 because at the first enoucounter `nmap` did not give me any information. After running it it turns out the port is filtered for outside connections. I can access it using internal server.

```bash
21/tcp filtered ftp
```

Now that I have credentials for FTP server I can login using them, but since the port is filtered for me. I will pass the credentials from BurpSuite in URL, Since `upload` page is configured to use FTP protocol it will be easier.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/09.png" alt="09" style="zoom:150%;" />

I `curl`ed the URL given by server, it gave me list of files inside the FTP server. 

![10](/image/hackthebox/forge/10.png)  	 

I can access the files just by appending the filename after at the end of URL, so my url becomes `http://Admin.Forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@Localhost/.ssh/id_rsa` , Using the private SSH file I will now login to the machine.

# Getting root

SSHing into machine, I found interesting file inside `/opt/remote-manage.py`.

Also doing `sudo -l` reveals that I can execute this file as root user.

```bash
-bash-5.0$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for user on forge:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User user may run the following commands on forge:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py
```

Content of this files are as follows:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import random
import subprocess
import pdb

port = random.randint(1025, 65535)

try:
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', port))
    sock.listen(1)
    print(f'Listening on localhost:{port}')
    (clientsock, addr) = sock.accept()
    clientsock.send(b'Enter the secret passsword: ')
    if clientsock.recv(1024).strip().decode() != 'secretadminpassword':
        clientsock.send(b'Wrong password!\n')
    else:
        clientsock.send(b'Welcome admin!\n')
        while True:
            clientsock.send(b'\nWhat do you wanna do: \n')
            clientsock.send(b'[1] View processes\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[2] View free memory\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[3] View listening sockets\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[4] Quit\n')
            option = int(clientsock.recv(1024).strip())
            if option == 1:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ps aux').encode())
            elif option == 2:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('df').encode())
            elif option == 3:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ss -lnt').encode())
            elif option == 4:
                clientsock.send(b'Bye\n')
                break
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    pdb.post_mortem(e.__traceback__)
finally:
    quit()
```

Going through the script, It imports necessary modules for the script to run properly. `Port` variable is using randomly generated number between `1025-65535` to host the script on the output, then it binds it to localhost and the port number. Script then asks user for password, if it is `secretadminpassword` then goes to `while True` claus inside `else` part where user can select options from `1-4`. 

Now the interesting part is the `except`, where it is using `pdb` module, which is used for debugging purpose. `post_mortem()` function of `pdb` executes when the error is occured and the code part of the script will no longer continue, you cannot step in the execution/divert the execution, you just sent directly to shell.

So all I have to do is to cause an error in the exceution. 

I will login to another SSH shell to interact with the execution. I used `nc` for this purpose. 

All I did was to press `Enter key` and it dropped me right into `pdb` shell.

<img src="/image/hackthebox/forge/11.png" alt="11" style="zoom:80%;" />

From there I can just import `pty` module and give myself a proper shell.

I can login as root user from SSH if I want.
