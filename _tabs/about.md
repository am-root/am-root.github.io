#### Hello, My name is Janak Khairmode, and I'd like to express a few things.

I am an avid Information Security enthusiast and aiming to be a Red Teamer. I vehemently enjoy learning new things about infosec. I frequently play CTFs (Capture The Flag) on HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and Vulnhub, where I learnt about Active Directory, Web Application Pentesting, VAPT, and certain Red Team attack vectors, among other things. Bug bounties are something I do every now and then. On quest of learning new things I earned Bachelor's in Computer Science degree, where I gained eclectic understanding of Cloud computing/Architecture, Web services, Cyber Forensics, Data Science, Linux Administration, Software and Quality Assurance to name a few. I obained two certifications regarding ethical hacking , first is Certified Ethical hacker and Information Security, second is Master in Penetration Testing. To make my calibre vigorous I intend to get OSCP and CompTIA Security+ certifications. I am a voracious reader who enjoys photography.

Please know that you can find my socials on the left navigation bar.

I am currently appointed as Security Intern at [ProArch Technologies Inc.](https://www.proarch.com/). 

Feel free to reach out to me.
